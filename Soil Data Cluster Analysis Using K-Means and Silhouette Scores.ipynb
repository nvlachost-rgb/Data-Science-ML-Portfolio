Both the Linear and RBF kernels performed exceptionally well, achieving 96% accuracy and strong F1-scores for both classes. These results suggest that the dataset is likely linearly separable, which explains why the Linear kernel performed so well. While the Polynomial kernel achieved perfect precision for the benign class, its recall for the same class dropped significantly, resulting in an overall accuracy of 88%. On the other hand, the Sigmoid kernel came close to the Linear and RBF kernels with 95% accuracy.
